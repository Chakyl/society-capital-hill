## Sunlit Valley
### v2.7.0
^^^
--- 
- Renamed pack to Society: Sunlit Valley! This is a smaller update to prepare for the large content update that is 3.0!
- Replaced OPAC with FTB Chunks. Both are enabled for server backwards compatibility, but OPAC will be removed next update
- Added Chance and required population for Fish pond items in JEI
- Reworked Fish Pond quests to be more balanced and not depend on Create (Thanks providencedaemon!)
- Increased value of all Nether fish significantly 
- Neptuna now works like any other fish once the Skill is obtained
- Removed Bronzed Seashell from Crab Trap loot table because it doesn't stack and was annoying me
- Fixed fishing skills causing non-stackable items to duplicate
- Fixed Fly Fisher and School Fisher adding non-fish loot
